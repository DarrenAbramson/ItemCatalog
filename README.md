# ItemCatalog

To run this web application you must place it in an appropriately configured Vagrant installation and then run `python project.py`.

NOTE: the `client_secrets.json` file must be recreated in order to do authentication. My understanding is that it is bad practice to make this available on Github.

API endpoints are located at `http://localhost:8000/catalog.json` and at `http://localhost:8000/catalog.xml`.
